# WordPress AppExchange UTM Capture
This tiny WordPress Plugin will capture UTM Params, store them in a cookie and then replace UTM Params for
AppExchange links so that they carry-forward to any AppExchange generated Lead records.

You can combine this with the UTM capabilities of our other project appexchange-help-sfdx where the
UTM params are extracted from a Lead and used to add the Lead to a Campaign, facilitating Campaign Influence ROI Reporting.
